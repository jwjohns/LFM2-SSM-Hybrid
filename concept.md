I want to create a hybrid mlp+ssm of LFM2 small models. Architect how we achieve this

Thought for 21s

Awesome idea. Let‚Äôs sketch a clean, hybrid MLP + SSM variant inspired by the small LFM2 models (350M/700M/1.2B) but swapping LFM2‚Äôs short-range conv mixer for an SSM mixer (Mamba2-style) and keeping the model lean for edge/runtime efficiency.

Target: ‚ÄúLFM2-SSM-Small‚Äù (350M‚Äì1.2B)
1) High-level design

Backbone: decoder-only, GPT-style stack of N residual blocks.

Token mixer per block: Selective SSM (Mamba2-style) for sequence mixing (linear-time, long-context) + Gated MLP for channel mixing (fast local nonlinearity).

Interleave lite attention (optional): every K blocks insert grouped/limited attention (e.g., grouped-query or sliding-window) for crisp ICL and compositional reasoning while keeping KV-cache small. (Hybrids consistently help ICL and precision where pure SSMs struggle.) 
Data Artificer and code:Breaker

Positioning: unified rotary or equivalent PE that works for both attention and SSM; use RoPE for attn layers (when present) and let SSM learn its own implicit recency via parameters; if desired, adopt a unified rotary scheme from recent hybrid papers. 
arXiv

Tokenizer: reuse LFM2 tokenizer so weights/checkpoints and data tooling align with your current LFM2 small models. (LFM2 family and VL variants indicate stable backbones/tokens.)

Why this shape for LFM2? LFM2 already mixes short-range conv + grouped attention for speed/quality on device; replacing the conv mixer with an SSM keeps the on-device efficiency while extending context scalability and throughput (linear-time SSM).

(a) SSM Mixer (Mamba2-like)

x = x + DropPath( SSM( RMSNorm(x) ) )

The SSM uses selective state-space with learned input/output projections, gating and discretization for stability; implement using fused kernels (flash-mamba style) when available.

(b) Channel Mixer (Gated MLP)

x = x + DropPath( GatedMLP( RMSNorm(x) ) )

Gated MLP = SwiGLU/GEGLU with expansion

(c) Sparse/global layer (optional every K blocks)

x = x + DropPath( Attn_small( RMSNorm(x) ) )

Use grouped-query attention (as in LFM2) or sliding-window; small head count, short window, or groups to cap KV.

(d) Residual topology: Pre-norm everywhere; use QKV precision clipping and RMSNorm Œµ ~ 1e-5.

3) Model sizes & ratios (good starting points)
Variant	d_model	n_layers	ffn_expansion	SSM:Attn ratio	Params ‚âà
350M	896	24	3.5√ó	5:1 (every 6th block has attn)	0.35B
700M	1152	28	3.5√ó	5:1	0.7B
1.2B	1536	30	4.0√ó	4:1 (every 5th has attn)	1.2B

Notes:

Prefer more SSM than attention; hybrids like Jamba/Samba/NeMo hybrids show lifts with modest attn frequency while keeping linear-time behavior dominant.

If you want pure MLP+SSM only, set ratio to ‚àû (no attn) and rely on SSM + MLP; you‚Äôll gain throughput but may lose some ICL precision.

4) Training recipe

Data

Start from your LFM2 small checkpoints (post-trained) as init; keep tokenizer. (LiquidAI publishes 350M/700M/1.2B.) 
Hugging Face

Mix: code(10‚Äì20%), math(5‚Äì10%), general web+books, instructions/chat. Maintain the LFM2 edge bias (concise instructions, short form, device-friendly prompts).

Curriculum

Warm-start distillation (2‚Äì3B tokens): KD from a strong teacher on next-token + logits matching + feature-distill at mixer outputs.

Mixed-objectives (3‚Äì5B tokens): causal LM + UL2-style denoising (short spans), short-context preference pairs.

Long-context extension: use YA RN/LC rewarmers; train SSM with randomized chunk packing up to target context (128k feasible with SSM).

SFT (50‚Äì200k examples): instruction tuning for your edge tasks.

DPO/RLHF (optional): light-touch for helpfulness/harmlessness; keep it small to preserve latency.

Optimization

AdamW with Œ≤2=0.95, cosine LR, warmup 2k‚Äì4k steps; ŒºP or scaled init helpful for stability.

Sequence packing + flash-mamba kernels where available; bfloat16 params, fp8 activations if your toolchain supports (you‚Äôve done FP8 before).

Gradient checkpointing and ZeRO-3 (or FSDP sharding).

Regularizers

z-loss on logits, attn/KV norm caps (if using attn), state clipping for SSM, light stochastic depth (0‚Äì0.1).

5) Inference & deployment

Export to TensorRT-LLM (SSM plugin + fused RMSNorm/linear), ExecuTorch for CPU/NPU on mobile (LFM2 targets on-device; you‚Äôll align with their deployment story), and GGUF path for llama.cpp-like runtimes if you write a simple SSM op kernel (you‚Äôve done GGUF ports). 
Liquid AI

Quantization: W8A8 baseline; try W4G128 weight-only for edge; ensure SSM kernels remain fused post-quant.

Caching: SSM layers are cache-free (no KV), so memory scales with active states only; your rare attn layers keep a tiny KV.

6) Minimal PyTorch skeleton (pseudo-code)
class SSMBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d, ssm_cfg, mlp_mult=4.0, p_drop=0.0):
        super().__init__()
        self.n1 = RMSNorm(d); self.ssm = Mamba2(d, **ssm_cfg)  # fused kernel if available
        self.n2 = RMSNorm(d); self.mlp = GatedMLP(d, int(d*mlp_mult))
        self.drop = StochasticDepth(p_drop)
    def forward(self, x):
        x = x + self.drop(self.ssm(self.n1(x)))
        x = x + self.drop(self.mlp(self.n2(x)))
        return x

class AttnBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d, n_heads=8, window=1024, grouped=True, p_drop=0.0):
        super().__init__()
        self.n = RMSNorm(d)
        self.attn = GroupedOrSWA(d, n_heads, window)  # small, local/global-lite
        self.drop = StochasticDepth(p_drop)
    def forward(self, x):
        return x + self.drop(self.attn(self.n(x)))

class LFM2_SSM_Small(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab, d, n_layers, attn_every=6, **cfg):
        super().__init__()
        self.embed = nn.Embedding(vocab, d)
        blocks = []
        for i in range(n_layers):
            blocks.append(SSMBlock(d, cfg['ssm'], mlp_mult=cfg['mlp_mult'], p_drop=cfg['sd']))
            if (i+1) % attn_every == 0 and cfg.get('use_attn', True):
                blocks.append(AttnBlock(d, **cfg['attn']))
        self.blocks = nn.ModuleList(blocks)
        self.out = nn.Linear(d, vocab, bias=False)
    def forward(self, ids):
        x = self.embed(ids)
        for b in self.blocks: x = b(x)
        return self.out(RMSNorm(x))

7) Training/compute estimates (rough)

350M: 8√óA100-80G or your 2√ó3090 rig with activation remat; 2‚Äì3 tokens/sec/GPU at 8k ctx SSM-heavy.

1.2B: 16√óA100-80G (data parallel) or mixed cluster with ZeRO-3; SSM gives notably lower memory than full-attn for long ctx.

(Expect throughput + memory wins vs same-size transformer because SSM avoids quadratic attention; numerous hybrid reports echo this trend.)

8) Evaluation focus

ICL tasks: Reorder, copy-span, tool-use‚Äîensure the sparse attn cadence is sufficient (try attn_every = 8 ‚Üí 5).

Long-context: Needle-in-haystack 128k+, long book QA‚ÄîSSM should shine.

Edge latency: cold start, prefill, and tok/s on CPU/NPU; compare with LFM2 baselines (Liquid reports strong on-device perf).

10) Concrete next steps for you

Decide cadence: start with attn_every=6 on 350M; compare with no-attn ablation.

Fork your LFM2-1.2B repo and drop in SSMBlock replacing conv mixer; keep grouped attention layers per cadence.

KD bootstrapping from your best teacher for 2‚Äì3B tokens; then domain-mix.

Quantize & export to your GGUF/ExecuTorch paths; measure edge perf vs LFM2 baseline.

Iterate on mlp_mult (3.0‚Äì4.0) and SSM width/state for best latency-quality Pareto.

If you want, I can draft the exact PyTorch modules (Mamba2 kernel wrapper + grouped attention) and a NeMo/Lightning training script with configs for 350M and 1.2B, plus a small ExecuTorch export stub for SSM ops.

You said:
yeah i think the 1.2b is better suited to this right? 
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 14s

Yeah‚Äîthe 1.2B is the sweet spot for this hybrid. Here‚Äôs why and how I‚Äôd run it:

Why 1.2B is better

Capacity vs. stability: Hybrids (SSM + MLP + a pinch of attention) benefit from a bit more width/depth so the SSM can carry long-context structure while MLP handles feature mixing without underfitting. At ~1.2B you avoid the ‚Äútight capacity‚Äù issues you‚Äôll feel at 350‚Äì700M on code/math and tool-use.

ICL & compositionality: Sparse/global-lite attention every ~5 blocks plus larger channels improves in-context learning and copy/edit tasks without blowing up KV memory.

Edge/runtime: 1.2B quantizes cleanly (W8A8 / W4G128) and still fits your edge-story; SSM keeps memory linear and cache-free.

Concrete 1.2B config (good first pass)

Tokenizer: LFM2‚Äôs

d_model: 1536

n_layers: 30

FFN (Gated MLP): expansion 4.0 (‚âà 6144) with SwiGLU/GEGLU

SSM: Mamba2-style selective SSM, state width 256, chunk 128, fused kernels, state clipping

Attention (optional): grouped/sliding window every 5th block, n_heads=8, window=1024, no ALiBi (RoPE if you keep attn)

Norm/Res: Pre-RMSNorm (Œµ=1e-5), DropPath up to 0.1 linearly scaled with depth

Positional: RoPE for the attn blocks; SSM learns its own recency

Context target: 64k (extendable to 128k during LC phase)

Training recipe tuned for you

Phase A ‚Äì KD Warmstart (2‚Äì3B tokens):

Teacher: your best larger model.

Loss: NLL + logits MSE; intermediate feature taps at mixer outputs (20‚Äì40% weight).

Optim: AdamW Œ≤2=0.95, lr peak 2.5e-4, 2‚Äì4k warmup, cosine decay, z-loss 1e-4.

Phase B ‚Äì Mixed LM (3‚Äì5B tokens):

Data mix: code 15‚Äì20%, math 5‚Äì10%, web/books/chat the rest; keep LFM2‚Äôs concise-instruction bias.

Pack sequences; vary lengths (2k‚Üí64k) with 30‚Äì40% long chunks for SSM.

Phase C ‚Äì Long-context rewarmer (0.5‚Äì1B tokens):

Ramp to 64k‚Äì128k using randomized chunking + cross-chunk losses.

Phase D ‚Äì SFT (50‚Äì200k examples):

Your domains (ads/DevOps/robotics). Keep it short to preserve latency.

(Optional) DPO/RLHF: light pass only.

Compute & memory (practical)

Full finetune: 1.2B in bf16 is ~2.4 GB weights; Adam adds ~12‚Äì14 bytes/param (optimizer+master) ‚Üí ~16‚Äì18 GB if not sharded.

Your 2√óRTX 3090 (24 GB): Use FSDP ZeRO-3 + activation checkpointing. Global batch will be small (e.g., 256‚Äì512 tokens/GPU/step packed).

If that‚Äôs tight, do LoRA (rank 16‚Äì64) on SSM + MLP projections; optionally freeze embeddings/out.

Inference:

FP16 ‚âà 2.4 GB; W8A8 ‚âà 1.2 GB; W4G128 ‚âà ~0.6 GB.

No KV cache for SSM layers; tiny KV for the sparse attn ones ‚Üí good for long ctx on commodity GPUs/CPU.

Ablations to run (fast signal)

Attn cadence: every 5 vs 8 vs none (pure SSM+MLP).

MLP expansion: 3.5√ó vs 4.0√ó.

SSM state width: 192 vs 256 vs 320.

Long-context ramp: 32k‚Üí64k vs direct 64k.
